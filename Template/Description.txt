Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass
but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.


Template pattern is used to define and enforcing certain sequential algorithm steps in programming paradigm.
It helps in defining the skeleton of an algorithm, which shall not be overridden in sub classes.



It defines the sequential steps to execute a multi-step algorithm and optionally can provide a default
implementation as well (based on requirements).



When we have pre-defined steps to achieve some algorithm.
When we want to avoid duplicating code, moving the common implementation and steps in the base class.




we have certain steps in fixed order which all building classes must follow. So, we can use template
method design pattern to solve this problem.
