The null object pattern helps us to write a clean code avoiding null checks where ever possible.


It is not possible to implement null object pattern in every scenario. Sometimes, it is likely to 
return a null reference and perform some null check



A null object is also known as a Stub, an Active Nothing or an Active Null. It helps our program logic to get rid of null 
checks where ever possible. We all know, that we can not call methods on a null reference as it results in a NullReferenceException.
The null object pattern provides a non-functional object in place of a null reference and therefore allows methods to be called on it.



In object-oriented computer programming, a null object is an object with no referenced value or with defined neutral ("null") 
behavior. The null object design pattern describes the uses of such objects and their behavior (or lack thereof).
