The Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls (using the new operator) with calls 
to a special factory method. Don’t worry: the objects are still created via the new operator, but it’s being called from
within the factory method. Objects returned by a factory method are often referred to as “products.”




A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but 
let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.


The Factory Method Pattern is also known as Virtual Constructor.


Factory Method Pattern allows the sub-classes to choose the type of objects to create.




The Factory Method pattern abstracts the decision-making process from the calling class



Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a 
class defer instantiation to subclasses.


A factory is an object that creates objects without the use of a constructor.
